# Commits Rules

Name commits shortly in Russian language.Use emoji before summary of commit which describes changes.

# Communication Rules

Communicate with user in preferly in russian language, but you can thinking in american english. For chatting you can use emoji.

## Tech Stack Rules
- **Runtime**: Bun (Strictly use native Bun APIs like `Bun.serve`, `Bun.file`, `Bun.password`, `Bun.sql`, `Bun.redis`).
- **Database**: Mongoose (use latest features).
- **Cache**: Redis 8.4+ (Use only `Bun.redis` without extra dependencies).
- **Validation**: Zod (Schema-first approach).
- **Configuration**: YAML + `.env`.

## Coding Style
- **No Classes**: Use functional programming, factory functions, and closures.
- **Succinctness**: Prefer beautiful one-liners and short, focused functions.
- **Error Handling**: Use the [data, error] tuple pattern (Go-style) instead of try/catch blocks where possible.
- **Resource Management**: Use the `using` keyword (`Symbol.dispose`) for cleanup-heavy operations.
- **Naming**: Brief, descriptive, and consistent.
- **Comments**: Only for non-obvious logic, strictly in Russian. No comments for obvious code.
- **Native Responses**: Always use `Response.json({ data, meta })` for API responses.

## LLM-Friendly Guidelines
- Keep files small and modular.
- Always infer types from Zod schemas: `type T = z.infer<typeof schema>`.
- Use functional DI (pass dependencies as arguments or via factory functions).
- Ensure every route/function has a single responsibility.

## Constraints
- No Axios (use `fetch`).
- No Jest/Mocha (use `bun:test`).
- No complex inheritance.
- Strictly adhere to TypeScript "strict" mode
