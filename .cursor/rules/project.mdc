# Dickobrazz Server Rules

## Project Overview
- Backend API for Dickobrazz (dickobrazz.com), a Telegram bot with daily size, leaderboards, seasons, achievements, and analytics.
- Stack: Bun (stable), TypeScript (strict), Bun.serve, MongoDB 8.2.3 (mongoose), Redis 8.4 (Bun.redis), Zod, YAML+dotenv, Biome, prom-client, Random.org (@randomorg/core) + crypto.getRandomValues fallback (urandom), typed-inject for DI with string raw tokens, FAA (Feature-Action Architecture).

### Project architecture

See the `./Feature-Action-Architecture` docs.

Examples with TS & Bun & typed-inject: `Feature-Action-Architecture/examples/ts-bun.md`

AI notes: `Feature-Action-Architecture/AI.md`
Architecture Manifest: `Feature-Action-Architecture/MANIFEST.md`

### DI Pattern
- Factory functions accepting deps (functional DI via `typed-inject` or manual wiring).
- Entity factories: `createUserEntity(mongo) => { findById, getOrCreate, ... }`.
- Feature action factories: `createLoginAction(userEntity, config) => async (data) => {...}`.
- Container assembled in `app/container.ts`, resolves all dependencies.

## Core Rules
- Use Bun native APIs where possible (Bun.serve, Bun.file).
- In Bun.serve, return Response.json({ data }) directly (no manual Content-Type).
- Write to stdout via `Bun.write(Bun.stdout, "")`.
- Redis: use built-in `Bun.redis` only; do not add Redis dependencies.
- MongoDB: use mongoose only.
- Dependencies: add via `bun add`; run scripts via `bun run`.
- Logging: log starts, stops, connections, errors, and successful operations.
- All functions must be typed; avoid `any`.
- Operations use Moscow time (Europe/Moscow, UTC+3).
- Keep files small and LLM-friendly; single responsibility per file/function.
- No comments unless logic is non-obvious; comments can be in Russian.
- No Classes: Use functional programming, factory functions, and closures.
- Prefer one-liner routes and small, single-purpose functions.
- Use `using` for resource lifecycle where possible.
- Prefer returning tuples from services instead of try/catch-heavy flows.
- Route error handling through Bun.serve error handler, including Zod errors.
- External API calls must use timeouts via AbortController.
- Keep `/metrics` separate for prom-client; do not mix with API logic.
- Naming: Brief, descriptive, and consistent.

## Testing & Checks
- After any change, run: `bun run check:fix`, `bun run test`, `bun run typecheck`.
- Write tests for logic that is environment-independent.
- Use Russian language in test `it()` descriptions.
